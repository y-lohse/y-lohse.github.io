title: Summer jobs

I set out to get my first summer job when I became 16 â€” when it becomes legal to work in France. I worked at a do-it-all boy in my city (gardening, cleaning the grounds, etc), and then at a metal factory in Switzerland, again mainly cleaning metal pieces, loading trails of metal pieces, straightening metal pieces... well, you get the idea. Not really great, and definitely not related to Computer Science - but you really appreciate to work in an office after you've been through working at a factory.
