At nearly 18, I was in my first year of studies, and we had to do a 2 week intern ship in any company. A week before the start of the intern ship, I still hadn't found a company I could do my intern ship at - or rather I hadn't been looking around a lot. One of my best friends dad happened to own a [software company in Switzerland](http://www.cadrz.ch/content.cfm?nav=2&amp;content=5), and he was nice enough to hire me.

Life as a trainee there was excellent – they let me do real work, on internal products. The two weeks went great, and I asked if I could stay to work over the summer. The company being happy with my work so far, this wasn't a problem at all and I worked there for 2 more month, mainly helping debugging a software used to sync user accounts between different systems.

Boy did I learn a lot about programming.

When in my second year I had to do another, longer intern ship, I very naturally went back to the CAD Rechenzentrum – and this time I worked on a client product. The company mainly produces a software for the state of Switzerland to manage their (oh so many) bridges and tunnels. I worked on a [map displayed in a webpage](http://www.cadrz.ch/content.cfm?nav=34&content=56 "KUBA Web") used to indicate the location of the different constructions, with map images that the company owned. You could pan the map, zoom in/out, and click the locations to get details on them - all of it done in javascript.
