Back in 2005 while I was going through highschool I lacked any of the skills required to build something from the ground up. So instead, I spent a lot of time playing online games – escpecially one called [Travian](http://www.travian.fr/). Not onlyplaying though, I also spent countless hours on the [community boards](http://forum.travian.fr/) and on the IRC channel helping newcomers understanding the finer aspects of the game.

After a year or so, [the company behind the game](http://www.traviangames.com/en.html) started hiring volunteers to run the french version of the game. I became board moderator and later "super-moderator", in charge of the whole forum – at that time around 2000 active users and divided into over 15 categories. I would also participate in the recruitment and training of new moderators alongside my boss and one other supermod.

We brought the crew up from 5-6 people to a full 20, all trained und supervised – my first manager experiences. It was a bit more stressfull (especially since it was still volunteering) but I met a lot of very nice and interesting people there.

Around 2007 my boss left his position and I became board admin at only 17 – now with over 3000 active users and head of a 20-25 persons crew I had mostly recruited myself. However other aspects of the job had been going down the drain for a while, and after a couple of months and several brutal organizational changes coming from the main company, a lot of staff members left the ship – including me.

Management itself left a bitter taste; I learned that taking responsibilities without sound reason is quite a bad idea, and was better at doing things than telling people how to do them.
