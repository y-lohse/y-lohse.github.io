title: Board Admin @ Travian Games
---
I always loved to invest my spare time and side projects. But back in 2005, I was going through high school and lacked any of the skills required to build something from the ground up. So instead, I spent a lot of time playing online games. I was playing a brand new game called [travian](http://www.travian.fr/ "Travian"). That's right, I played browser based games instead of fancy MMORPGs.

A part from the game itself, I also spent countless hours on the [community boards](http://forum.travian.fr/) and on the IRC channel. The community was brand new, there was almost no team to take are of the game. So I started answering many questions from newcomers on the boards, and helping out were I could. The satisfaction of helping people really was the sole motivation, and it had better be â€“ there were no rewards ahead.

After a year or so, [the company behind the game](http://www.traviangames.com/en.html) hired an admin to take care of the french community, and he in turn started recruiting a team to help him. I became forum moderator, and loved every bit of it; I started out answering questions (just like I used to do), but also had to keep my part of the forum clean, locking and moving topics, and making sure every thing was in check. At some point I started spending more time being a moderator (on the irc chan as well) than playing the actual game.

I was about to turn 17 and was offered a higher position - I became a super-moderator. I was in charge of the whole forum - at that time around 2000 active users and divided into over 15 parts. But I would also participate in recruiting new moderators, training and teaching them how to keep their part of the forum alive, but under control ; they had to be firm, but not tyrannic.

I wasn't aware of it, but I was going through my first experience as a manager. I think I did ok : with the 2 people occupying similar positions to mine, we brought the forum team from a 5-6 men crew to a full 15 person staff, all of them trained and - I guess - happy to do their volunteer job. Because yes, all of this was of course volunteering, even though I spent roughly 4 hours a day in this, and much more on week ends.

Managing a team proved itself somewhat more stressful than just moderating forums, but again, I took great pleasure in doing it. The job itself was nice, but the team we had built was great. They were a bunch of very fun and interesting people, and when we weren't busy working, we we're happily chatting together on irc.

This was around 2007, and the forum admin decided to quit. He was one of the 2 companions we had built the team with, and I was chosen to replace him. At only 17, I became admin of a board that had over 3000 active users, and head of a 20 persons crew I had been recruiting myself. I was proud and happy, and things kicked out well.

However, things went somewhat down the drain over the course of the next monthes. Several changes at the head of the team made most of us leave - including me.
Management itself left a bitter taste; I learned that taking responsibilities without sound reason is quite a bad idea, and was better at doing things than telling people how to do them.
