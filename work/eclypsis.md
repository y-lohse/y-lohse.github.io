During all this time, I rarely stopped playing the game itself, and by the start of 2007 I was amongst the best players in France. I met a guy for the second time ingame - we had briefly been friends a year ago, before loosing sight of each other. At the start of a new travian server, [Matthieu](http://urls.fr/pms "Matthieu's portfolio") (that's his name) gathered a couple of friends to create a clan, and I was among them. We quickly took over the whole server. We were the best clan, composed of about 30 players, all of them ranking in the top 50, 10 of them in the top 20. We ruled over our virtual lands like tyrants, which also happens to be our clan name. We lied, we betrayed, we stole - lots of fun.

A couple of months later, I would quit my position as forum admin, and this was a clear signal that travian was going downwards. 6 more month of disastrous management and players would start looking elsewhere - or at least that's what we figured. Among the people in the clan, there was another friend of Matthieu's, who knew how to code. He told both of us he had ideas for a travian like game, but without its flaws; all he needed was our programming skills.

As developers, we knew the task was huge; but we didn't realize how huge exactly. We agreed.

Pierre and I would take care of the PHP and javascript code. I hired another friend of mine to handle the html & css, and we went out searching for a designer while starting to work on the game. We learned a lot - I got better and better at programming.I already knew everything there was to know about the programing language itself; but I also understood that pure technical knowledge didn't make you a food programmer. I needed understanding of broader concepts, of software architecture and design. The team eventually met "in real life", spent 4 days in the front-end developers parent house coding night and day. A couple of designers came and went. We spent countless hours working on the project.

2009 arrived and a new designer started to work with us. This was also the rise of HTML5, and front end development became appealing to me. The other frond end developer, Clowrid, left the project, so I took over the front end part. The PHP code base was now advanced enough so that Pierre could handle the remaining parts alone. I set out to create and code the new game UI with our designer.

Over the years, there had been several difficult phases, where the project had been stuck. At times I had been coding alone for weeks; at other times Pierre did the same. It was hard to keep the motivation up over such a long time span, especially without being able to show of the result or get feedback.

One year later, I was done with my studies and immediately started my first real job. Eclypsis - the name of the game - needed more or less 6 more month of work before the beta. I did try to keep working on it; but after 3 month at my new job I had a burn out and needed to spend my freetimes on other things then coding.... so i left the project.

Eclypsis went live a couple of months later, re-branded [Nemeria](http://www.nemeria.com/). I asked if I could help again, either by investing money in the company or through my experience as a board admin, but the proposal was rejected. I was disappointed, but I now had a very interesting job that had to focus on. I had become a very good developer, both on the front and back end. I learned the value of software design, code DRYness and other similar concepts. Other side projects helped, but Eclypsis most of all thought me what I now know about programming.

*Update (13-07-14)* : apparently Nemeria was recently shut down.
