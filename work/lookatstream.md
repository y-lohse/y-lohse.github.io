For the 2 next years, I almost didn't write a line of code outside my work. My job had been exiting, and again, I had become much better. My previously in-existent design skills had grown by necessity, and I was now good enough to handle any web project almost on my own.

I want to my first ever conference, [the Web Event Lyon](http://event.lafermeduweb.net/). For the very first time in my life, I met many other developers, designers, and people working in the same field than I did. The talks they gave were awesome, and they the motivation I had lost returned. About a week later, I was skyping with Clowrid, the other front end developer from Eclypsis who had remained a close friend over the years. He had a good knowledge of the professional gaming environment and was building a new site called [look at stream](http://lookatstream.com/ "Live streams from the biggest games out there"). He asked if I wanted to help out â€“ I hesitated a split second and said yes.

I spent 3 straight days designing the site and rewriting most of the code that was already there - and we launched. The site simply allows the users to watch live streams from games like League of Legends or Starcraft 2, originally displayed on <http://www.own3d.tv/> or <http://www.twitch.tv/>. Clowrid used his contact network to start promoting the site, and it has been doing fairly well since then : the user base is constantly growing and we reach pretty high traffic peaks during big tournaments. We recently created an organization around the website that could hold the rights and cash in the incomes.
