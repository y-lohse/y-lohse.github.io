During my last year at the university in 2009, I had the opportunity to study in alternation, ie. studying a week at the university, then working a week for a company. I was hired by a business called Kairos Media and worked there for a year.

Kairos Media's main activity was maintaining 2 websites providing newspaper resellers with useful tools. As their lead developer, I developed several new features, updated existing ones and fixed a lot of stuff around the website. Requirements would often change during the coding phases, there was absolutely no process or work flow. The code of the site was very old and flawed all over the place - writing clean code in such a messy environment wasn't easy.

But I learned new skills nonetheless there. I was already a good developer when I arrived, but nothing more - I expected to be told what to do, and then I would proceed coding it. But things didn't work that way in a small business; I was often times asked to give my opinion on new products or services, to deliver time estimates or to create ads myself... Being the technical referrer made me grow to a whole new level, and by the end of the year I would often be the one suggesting changes to improve the business.

It didn't prove enough though; over the course of the year, the CEO had to let go half of the crew. And at the end of the year, they were close to shutting down the whole business - from a 10 person crew when I joined, we would shrink down to a 3 person team. My alternation contract was for a year, but I was offered a long term contract... that I chose to decline. We were often paid late, I would have to work from my home, and I felt the company was marching towards it's end.

With two weeks left to work at Kairos Media and no intention to stay any longer, I had to start looking for a job. Before I really had a chance to work out a plan, another opportunity presented itself. At the university, I ran into a man talking with one of my friends, who had done his year in alternation in the local business school. He wasn't going to keep the job, so I knew the position was open.
