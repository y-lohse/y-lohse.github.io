[ENSIIE](http://www.ensiie.fr/) is a computer science engineering school in Strasbourg. While working at [Caldera](/work/caldera.html), I was given the opportunity to teach a small class about design there, which I did for two years.

I taught around 15 students some fundamentals about user interface design, user experience, etc. The class was only 20 hours so I tried to explain why good design matters and give them simple, practical tips to "get by". For the hands-on part, each student had to design a simple mobile app with 3 views.

I decided to stop teaching after my second year. I found the experience only moderately fun — I like talking about design, but keeping students engaged is *hard*. But mostly, It was just too much work. Preparing for a 2 hour lesson took me about four times as much time, and it felt like studying for school over again. It simply wasn't something I wanted to make room for anymore.
