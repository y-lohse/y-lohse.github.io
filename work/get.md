With two weeks left to work at Kairos Media and no intention to stay any longer, I had to start looking for a job. Before I really had a chance to work out a plan, another opportunity presented itself. At the university, I ran into a man talking with one of my friends, who had done his year in alternation in the local business school. He wasn't going to keep the job, so I knew the position was open.

I asked my future boss if the position was indeed open. It was, and I quickly got my first real job, without even sending a resume - they were in a hurry and looked it up themselves before I even moved a finger. it was a long term contract too. All good.

The company is called [Groupe ESC Troyes](http://get-formation.fr/ "Groupe ESC Troyes") and I still work there today. It's been two and a half years now and everything went just fine. It's more than just a business school ~ we provide education in management, tourism, design… We have departments dealing with education for unemployed people, for teenagers coming out of jail… [Well they have a website that tells it all](http://get-formation.fr/groupe-esc-troyes).

In those two years, I developed a bunch of new websites to help us promote our different activities and events we organize. I worked on internal as well as external applications, always web based. But most importantly, after one year there, we started a complete redesign of the aging website. Not only graphical redesign, the whole code base would change as well to meet new requirements.

It took us roughly 6 month of work – the website was huge, around 300 different pages and 20 different layouts. The content management had to work on a separate website and the publication system needed several level of validation. The communication agency that had created our new logo designed a couple of page layouts, and I did the remaining ones.  The project was warmly greeted – user testing gave excellent results and statistics rose.

Again, I think I grew a lot in this job - so much that I changed the way I called myself. I was a developer coming in, a bearded programmer to whom design and integration was a mere necessity. I now define myself as a front-end developer - while I still enjoy long hours of pure coding, my design skills improved a lot. And with them, understanding of the complexity that resides in user interface design, interaction design and usability. I am know very aware of the problems and love to tackle them. In the same time, HTMl &amp; CSS evolved; instead of stacking divs and writing tons of css to get a decent browser support, we can now focus on semantics and page speed optimization, changes that made front-end development a very interesting challenge.
