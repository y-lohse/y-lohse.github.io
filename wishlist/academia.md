title: Disrupt Academia
description: Academia sucks hard, but we can change that

Yeah, I know — “disrupt” is on my bullshit list too. But sometimes it's the right word.

## What's wrong?

During [my time at Groupe ESC Troyes](http://yannick-lohse.fr/work/get.html), I befriended some researchers. All very interesting people, an absolute joy exchanging with them every time.

They also live in a wicked world. Apparently the quality of your work isn't the real factor there — it's more a matter of who's side you're on. Different schools of thoughts hate each other to death, high profile journals are managed by jackasses who only publish either a) Papers that re-proove things we already knew or b) Papers from their friends. Ideally both at once.

Also, you don't really get to choose your side. When you start as a post-grad you get assigned to a tutor, and BAM! you're in his camp. After a couple of years you *may* get a chance to change sides.

## Those are isolated cases Yannick, Academia is a great world

I haven't done a Phd, so I really can't tell. But most of my Phd friends seemed pretty unanimous. Also, [other people](https://medium.com/ladybits-on-medium/2f9fcaf6b313) seem to confirm som malfunctions.

And, well, have you tried getting access to academic papers? You usually need to pay some subscription fee to get access to a huge database you don't really care about. And even then it's a 12 point size pdf you can't understand. [It's fucking unusable](https://medium.com/medium-ideas/53cb9bf4f10d).

## What should be done?

The internet is really good at sharing knowledge (Wikipedia, StackOverflow, …) and making people interact with each other (social media). And you can combine both and get great results, like [GitHub](https://github.com/). Sharing knowledge about code, working with strangers on Open Source. We've made giant leaps in these areas over the last years.

Well I have a vision of Academia following exactly that path. There's a huge potential for a giant, open source network of knowledge. Internet could empower researchers to do better work, and their work could be made available to everyone.

I have some quite concrete thoughts on this, but making this vision a reality would require a huge amount of time with no granted return on investment. Right now it's just a dream but if you have thoughts on this, i'd love to hear them.
