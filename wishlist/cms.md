title: A CMS that shift gears
description: CMSs are mostly outdated. This needs to change.

Many people and institutions want to publish content online, of various nature. This is usually done through a Content Management System that abstracts away all the technical side and leaves the user with the sole duty of managing content.

## What's wrong with them?

They have mostly been built in a pre-responsive web era. The web has evolved a great deal in the last couple of years but historical CMSs have not been following along, neither have their users. Because they are powering a large chunk of the content that is put online, this will become a problem at some point. We'd better fix it now.

## What is to be done?

I'm not sure.

People are aware of this issue. I shared [my na√Øve thoughts on this](https://medium.com/design-ux/2234ce29b6f8). I'm essentially advocating inline editing, [but maybe I'm wrong](http://alistapart.com/column/wysiwtf). [Karen McGrane knows this shit,](http://karenmcgrane.com/2012/09/04/adapting-ourselves-to-adaptive-content-video-slides-and-transcript-oh-my/) she's been talking about it for some time now. [Mark Boulton](http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/wysiwtfftwomg) has thoughts on this as well.

But that's actually only the content strategy part of the problem. I've heard of lots of new CMSs that are being built right now and try to solve this problem, so we're probably okay on that. [See Rasmus Skjoldan & Typo3 Neos](http://rasmusskjoldan.com/post/58364140673/wysiftw).

## What else is to be done?

Having a cool CMS that deals with publishing-for-multiple-contexts is really just one step imo. Two other issues I'm aware of are

1. Ecosystem
2. Education

### Ecosystem

The main reason why Wordpress is so dominant right now is because of the ecosystem [ref. needed]. If we want a new, better CMS to take the world over, it needs to be super-pluginable. Themes. Widgets. Extensions. Whatever. It needs it all.

This is what I'm exploring in my freetime, without clear purpose for now. Maybe a super-lightweight core CMS, and then everything is just a plugin. Published and updated via git. You grant extensions rights like you grant app rights on your phone. 

The entry barrier for thrid-party developers should be low enough. I'd be happy to hear other peoples thoughts on this.

### Education

This may be outside the scope of a CMS. I touched on it at the very end of my medium article and it might be the only original thought in it. People who use CMSs are not educated, they are not aware of these issues. Maybe we need to adress that. I don't know, i need to give it more thoughts at some point.
