title: Making a difference
description: i want my work to have a noticeable impact
---
I want to work on a product, ideally from the ground up — but I want my work to have an impact on the whole company.

I had a job where I could only do minor tweaks to the main product, and then I had a cool job at Groupe ESC Troyes where I could strongly help shaping a product — just not the main one. I loved redesigning the website but it was just that, a website. However good it is, a University's website isn't going to change much about how prospective students perceive the university. Whether the project had colossal success or failure wasn't going to make a big impact on the company.

But I believe my work is really good (at least most of the time :-) and **I want to make a difference with what I do.** I'll face the consequences of failure if it gets there, but there's no reason for it.

There's a reasonable chance that I will doing just that at [Caldera](/work/caldera.html), but I can't talk about it yet.
