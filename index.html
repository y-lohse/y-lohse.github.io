<p class="f1 lh-title mb4">
	My name is Yannick.<br />
	I write <em>code</em> and design <em>user interfaces</em>.
</p>
<p class="f4 lh-copy">
	I mostly work with web technologies like php or javascript, but I don't feel strongly about languages. Some of my biggest influences code-wise are <a href="http://worrydream.com/#!/InventingOnPrinciple">Bret Victor</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjDsP5n2kSM">Jonathan Blow</a>.
</p>
<p class="f4 lh-copy">
	A coherent user experience doesn't live solely in code, so I get involved on the design side as well. I like thinking about information architecture and I'm a geek when it comes to game design, typography, and animations.
</p>
<p class="f4 lh-copy">
	Aside from that, I train <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRxrowcvOIw">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</a> at least three times a week. I'm not trying to become a champion or anything; it's just a very healthy and entertaining hobby with a great community.<br />
	I also play guitar and the occasional video game.
