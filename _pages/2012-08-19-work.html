I have been working full time for two and a half straight years now ; but I've had professional experiences before. Here's what I've been doing strictly professionally speaking.

<h2>Too Long ; Didn't Read</h2>
I tried to make it short, but it's a long story anyway. Here's the quick version :
<ul>
	<li>I did a couple of hard and uninteresting summer jobs</li>
	<li>Over the course of 5 months in 2 years, I was a trainee in a Swiss company, working on their secondary products as a developer</li>
	<li>Over a year, I had an alternation contract at a local web company, where I worked as lead developer.</li>
	<li>Since 2and a half years now, I work at <a title="Groupe ESC Troyes" href="http://get-formation.fr/">Groupe ESC Troyes</a> - I created the new "<a title="This is my baby." href="http://get-formation.fr/">flagship website</a>", and manage/create other ones</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summer jobs</h2>
I set out to get my first summer job when I became 16 - when it becomes legal to work in France. I worked at a do-it-all boy in my city (gardening, cleaning the grounds, etc), and then at a metal factory in Switzerland, again mainly cleaning metal pieces, loading trails of metal pieces, straightening metal pieces... well, you get the idea. Not really great, and definitely not related to Computer Science - but you really appreciate to work in an office after you've been through working at a factory.

Speaking of offices...
<h2>Intern ships</h2>

At nearly 18, I was in my first year of studies, and we had to do a 2 week intern ship in any company. A week before the start of the intern ship, I still hadn't found a company I could do my intern ship at - or rather I hadn't been looking around a lot. One of my best friends dad happened to own a <a title="CADRZ" href="http://www.cadrz.ch/content.cfm?nav=2&amp;content=5">software company in Switzerland</a>, and he was nice enough to hire me.

Life as a trainee there was excellent - they let me do real work, on internal products. The two weeks went great, and I asked if I could stay to work over the summer. The company being happy with my work so far, this wasn't a problem at all and I worked there for 2 more month, mainly helping debugging a software used to sync user accounts between different systems.

Boy did I learn a lot about programming.

When in my second year I had to do another, longer intern ship, I very naturally went back to the <a title="CAD Rechenzentrum" href="http://www.cadrz.ch/content.cfm?nav=2&amp;content=5">CAD Rechenzentrum</a> - and this time I worked on a client product. The company mainly produces a software for the state of Switzerland to manage their (oh so many) bridges and tunnels. I worked on a <a title="KUBA Web" href="http://www.cadrz.ch/content.cfm?nav=34&amp;content=56">map displayed in a webpage</a> used to indicate the location of the different constructions, with map images that the company owned. You could pan the map, zoom in/out, and click the locations to get details on them - all of it done in javascript.

<h2>First steps in the web industry</h2>

During my last year at the university in 2009, I had the opportunity to study in alternation, ie. studying a week at the university, then working a week for a company. I was hired by a business called Kairos Media and worked there for a year.

Kairos Media's main activity was maintaining 2 websites providing newspaper resellers with useful tools. As their lead developer, I developed several new features, updated existing ones and fixed a lot of stuff around the website. Requirements would often change during the coding phases, there was absolutely no process or work flow. The code of the site was very old and flawed all over the place - writing clean code in such a messy environment wasn't easy.

But I learned new skills nonetheless there. I was already a good developer when I arrived, but nothing more - I expected to be told what to do, and then I would proceed coding it. But things didn't work that way in a small business; I was often times asked to give my opinion on new products or services, to deliver time estimates or to create ads myself... Being the technical referrer made me grow to a whole new level, and by the end of the year I would often be the one suggesting changes to improve the business.

It didn't prove enough though; over the course of the year, the CEO had to let go half of the crew. And at the end of the year, they were close to shutting down the whole business - from a 10 person crew when I joined, we would shrink down to a 3 person team. My alternation contract was for a year, but I was offered a long term contract... that I chose to decline. We were often paid late, I would have to work from my home, and I felt the company was marching towards it's end.

<h2>A "real" job</h2>

With two weeks left to work at Kairos Media and no intention to stay any longer, I had to start looking for a job. Before I really had a chance to work out a plan, another opportunity presented itself. At the university, I ran into a man talking with one of my friends, who had done his year in alternation in the local business school. He wasn't going to keep the job, so I knew the position was open.

I asked my future boss if the position was indeed open. It was, and I quickly got my first real job, without even sending a resume - they were in a hurry and looked it up themselves before I even moved a finger. it was a long term contract too. All good.

The company is called <a title="Groupe ESC Troyes" href="http://get-formation.fr/">Groupe ESC Troyes</a> and I still work there today. It's been two and a half years now and everything went just fine. It's more than just a business school - we provide education in management, tourism, design... We have departments dealing with education for unemployed people, for teenagers coming out of jail.... <a href="http://get-formation.fr/groupe-esc-troyes">Well they have a website that tells it all</a>.

In those two years, I developed a bunch of new websites to help us promote our different activities and events we organize. I worked on internal as well as external applications, always web based. But most importantly, after one year there, we started a complete redesign of the aging website. Not only graphical redesign, the whole code base would change as well to meet new requirements.

It took us roughly 6 month of work - the website was huge, around 300 different pages and 20 different layouts. The content management had to work on a separate website and the publication system needed several level of validation. The communication agency that had created our new logo designed a couple of page layouts, and I did the remaining ones.Â  The project was warmly greeted - user testing gave excellent results and statistics rose.

Again, I think I grew a lot in this job - so much that I changed the way I called myself. I was a developer coming in, a bearded programmer to whom design and integration was a mere necessity. I now define myself as a front-end developer - while I still enjoy long hours of pure coding, my design skills improved a lot. And with them, understanding of the complexity that resides in user interface design, interaction design and usability. I am know very aware of the problems and love to tackle them. In the same time, HTMl &amp; CSS evolved; instead of stacking divs and writing tons of css to get a decent browser support, we can now focus on semantics and page speed optimization, changes that made front-end development a very interesting challenge.
