<h2>Studies</h2>
I'm French and studied in France. For my High School degree (baccaluréat) I specilized in literature and foreign languages. More specifically, I presented both the French and German high school diplomas (baccalauréat and abitur) and got both. I also earned some fancy English degrees on my way.

I then started my studies. I did a 2 year long DUT called Service et Réseaux de Communications. The name doesn't mean much, but we studied a lot. We focused heavily on computer science, graphic design and communication skills. But we also had project management, law, art, sound&amp;video lessons, etc. A lot of fields related to the interwebz.

Two awesome years. I did learn a lot of things, but most topics were covered quite loosely. The idea was to use the basics taught in class to further expand your skills by working on your own. that worked fairly well for me, and I spent a year and a half coding in Flash, PHP, and creating 3D models in 3DSMax.

I did a final year of studies - something called a "license pro", basically one more year after a DUT to get you a bachelor degree. They are tailored to suit companies needs and make you an effective employee right out of the gates.

I love music. Everyone does. I also play music. i've been playing the guitar for.. uh... 9 years I think. I also sing, but I don't do any concerts. I sometimes play at parties for fun, but it's just a hobby.
A big hobby though. I own 3 guitars, my very last and favorite one is a wonderful <a href="http://www.coleclarkguitars.com/product_fl1.asp">Cole Clark Fat Lady 1</a>. i also own a telecaster and a 12 string guitar.

I'm also doing a lot of sports. I fell in love with Brazilian Jiu Jitsu a year ago and I'm training about 3 times a week since then. It's quite different from other sports; sure there's a lot of technical skills  to master, but it's mainly about strategy - in real time of course. Just like a video game, except it's for real, which makes it a whole lot more fun.

Speaking of video games, I do love to play video games too - I just lack the time to play as much as I would like. i never skip an episode of Assassin's Creed, and I've spent many an hour on the NBA 2K series. I power through other games from time to time (Call of Duty &amp; friends), but I try not to spend too much time playing. It does help charging up my batteries, but I know it's much less productive than say writing my own games.
