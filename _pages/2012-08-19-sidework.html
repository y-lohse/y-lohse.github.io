As far as I know, I always loved to spend time and efforts in projects that were not directly related nor asked by my school, and later by my employers. <a title="Blog" href="/">My blog itself</a> is made of those, but there are projects that I have worked on for longer timespans- and I'd like to talk about them. They make up fora huge part of my life in the past years, so it's fairly long - but I provide a tl;dr version.
<h2>Too Long ; Didn't read</h2>

<h2>Travian</h2>
As I said, I always loved to invest my spare time and side projects. But back in 2005, I was going through high school and lacked any of the skills required to build something from the ground up. So instead, I spent a lot of time playing online games. I was playing a brand new game called <a title="Travian" href="http://www.travian.fr/">travian</a>. That's right, I played browser based games instead of fancy MMORPGs.

A part from the game itself, I also spent countless hours on the <a href="http://forum.travian.fr/">community boards</a> and on the IRC channel. The community was brand new, there was almost no team to take are of the game. So I started answering many questions from newcomers on the boards, and helping out were I could. The satisfaction of helping people really was the sole motivation, and it had better be - there were no rewards ahead.

After a year or so, <a title="Travian Games" href="http://www.traviangames.com/en.html">the company behind the game</a> hired an admin to take care of the french community, and he in turn started recruiting a team to help him. I became forum moderator, and loved every bit of it; I started out answering questions (just like I used to do), but also had to keep my part of the forum clean, locking and moving topics, and making sure every thing was in check. At some point I started spending more time being a moderator (on the irc chan as well) than playing the actual game.

I was about to turn 17 and was offered a higher position - I became a super-moderator. I was in charge of the whole forum - at that time around 2000 active users and divided into over 15 parts. But I would also participate in recruiting new moderators, training and teaching them how to keep their part of the forum alive, but under control ; they had to be firm, but not tyrannic.

I wasn't aware of it, but I was going through my first experience as a manager. I think I did ok : with the 2 people occupying similar positions to mine, we brought the forum team from a 5-6 men crew to a full 15 person staff, all of them trained and - I guess - happy to do their volunteer job. Because yes, all of this was of course volunteering, even though I spent roughly 4 hours a day in this, and much more on week ends.

Managing a team proved itself somewhat more stressful than just moderating forums, but again, I took great pleasure in doing it. The job itself was nice, but the team we had built was great. They were a bunch of very fun and interesting people, and when we weren't busy working, we we're happily chatting together on irc.

This was around 2007, and the forum admin decided to quit. He was one of the 2 companions we had built the team with, and I was chosen to replace him. At only 17, I became admin of a board that had over 3000 active users, and head of a 20 persons crew I had been recruiting myself. I was proud and happy, and things kicked out well.

However, things went somewhat down the drain over the course of the next monthes. Several changes at the head of the team made most of us leave - including me.
Management itself left a bitter taste; I learned that taking responsibilities without sound reason is quite a bad idea, and was better at doing things than telling people how to do them.

<h2>Eclypsis</h2>

When I say we ruled, I mean it.[/caption]

During all this time, I rarely stopped playing the game itself, and by the start of 2007 I was amongst the best players in France. I met a guy for the second time ingame - we had briefly been friends a year ago, before loosing sight of each other. At the start of a new travian server, <a title="Matthieu's portfolio" href="http://urls.fr/pms">Matthieu </a>(that's his name) gathered a couple of friends to create a clan, and I was among them. We quickly took over the whole server. We were the best clan, composed of about 30 players, all of them ranking in the top 50, 10 of them in the top 20. We ruled over our virtual lands like tyrants, which also happens to be our clan name. We lied, we betrayed, we stole - lots of fun.

A couple of months later, I would quit my position as forum admin, and this was a clear signal that travian was going downwards. 6 more month of disastrous management and players would start looking elsewhere - or at least that's what we figured. Among the people in the clan, there was another friend of Matthieu's, who knew how to code. He told both of us he had ideas for a travian like game, but without its flaws; all he needed was our programming skills.

As developers, we knew the task was huge; but we didn't realize how huge exactly. We agreed.

Pierre and I would take care of the PHP and javascript code. I hired another friend of mine to handle the html & css, and we went out searching for a designer while starting to work on the game. We learned a lot - I got better and better at programming.I already knew everything there was to know about the programing language itself; but I also understood that pure technical knowledge didn't make you a food programmer. I needed understanding of broader concepts, of software architecture and design. The team eventually met "in real life", spent 4 days in the front-end developers parent house coding night and day. A couple of designers came and went. We spent countless hours working on the project.

And yes, we just play <strong>that</strong> fast.[/caption]

2009 arrived and a new designer started to work with us. This was also the rise of HTML5, and front end development became appealing to me. The other frond end developer, Clowrid, left the project, so I took over the front end part. The PHP code base was now advanced enough so that Pierre could handle the remaining parts alone. I set out to create and code the new game UI with our designer.

Over the years, there had been several difficult phases, where the project had been stuck. At times I had been coding alone for weeks; at other times Pierre did the same. It was hard to keep the motivation up over such a long time span, especially without being able to show of the result or get feedback.

One year later, I was done with my studies and immediately started my first real job. Eclypsis - the name of the game - needed more or less 6 more month of work before the beta. I did try to keep working on it; but after 3 month at my new job I had a burn out and needed to spend my freetimes on other things then coding.... so i left the project.

Eclypsis went live a couple of months later, re-branded  <a href="http://www.nemeria.com/">Nemeria</a>. I asked if I could help again, either by investing money in the company or through my experience as a board admin, but the proposal was rejected. I was disappointed, but I now had a very interesting job that had to focus on. I had become a very good developer, both on the front and back end. I learned the value of software design, code DRYness and other similar concepts. Other side projects helped, but Eclypsis most of all thought me what I now know about programming.

<h2>Look at stream and the future</h2>

For the 2 next years, I almost didn't write a line of code outside my work. My job had been exiting, and again, I had become much better. My previously in-existent design skills had grown by necessity, and I was now good enough to handle any web project almost on my own.

I want to my first ever conference, <a href="http://event.lafermeduweb.net/">the Web Event Lyon</a>. For the very first time in my life, I met many other developers, designers, and people working in the same field than I did. The talks they gave were awesome, and they the motivation I had lost returned. About a week later, I was skyping with Clowrid, the other front end developer from Eclypsis who had remained a close friend over the years. He had a good knowledge of the professional gaming environment and was building a new site called <a title="Live streams from the biggest games out there" href="http://lookatstream.com/">look at stream</a>. He asked if I wanted to help out - I hesitated a split second and said yes.

I spent 3 straight days designing the site and rewriting most of the code that was already there - and we launched. The site simply allows the users to watch live streams from games like League of Legends or Starcraft 2, originally displayed on <a href="http://www.own3d.tv/">own3d.tv</a> or <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/">twitch</a>. Clowrid used his contact network to start promoting the site, and it has been doing fairly well since then : the user base is constantly growing and we reach pretty high traffic peaks during big tournaments. We recently created an organization around the website that could hold the rights and cash in the incomes.
