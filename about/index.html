	About me
</h1>

<p>
	Thanks for passing by here :)
</p>

<p>
	I'm a front-end developer from France. I'm passionate about design, code and everything in between. 
	Here you can read about a couple of things I do or did in my life, not work related. If you want to get in touch with me for whatever reason, I'd love to hear from you. You can send me a message on any social network.

	Studies
</h2>

<p>
	I studied in France. For my High School degree (baccaluréat) I specilized in literature and foreign languages. More specifically, I presented both the French and German high school diplomas (baccalauréat and abitur) and got both. I also earned some fancy English degrees on my way.
</p>

<p>
	After that I studied web-related stuff for 3 years. I did a 2 year long DUT called "Service et Réseaux de Communications" and a License Pro "Ingénieurie de l'Internet et du Multimédia". Awesomeyears, I learned a lot and worked on many different projects.

	Music & Sports
</h2>

<p>
	Like everyone Ilove music. I listen to music pretty much all day long, and play a couple of instruments, mainly guitare. My most praised possession is my <a href="http://www.coleclarkguitars.com/product_fl1.asp">Cole Clark Fat Lady 1</a>.
</p>

<p>
	I'm also doing a lot of sports. I fell in love with Brazilian Jiu Jitsu a year ago and I'm training about 3 times a week since then. It's quite different from other sports; sure there's a lot of technical skills  to master, but it's mainly about strategy - in real time of course. Just like a video game, except it's for real, which makes it a whole lot more fun.

<h2 class="subtitle">
	Trips
</h2>

<p>
	I'm a backpacker at heart and travel whenever i get the chance. I went hiking on my own in the Scottish highlands in 2011, and made a one-month-roundtrip in Peru in 2012. I'd love to see the USA, Australia, I need to visit Ireland and go back to Scandinavia, and discover any asian country, maybe China.
