*The following bitching is too long for a tweet but is otherwise pointless.*

France has this site called leboncoin.fr that people use to buy and sell stuff. It has a big audience so it serves its purpose well. But as you can see, it's ugly as hell.

Someone redesigned it a couple of years ago but it was only a little bit uglier before that. Because they redeisgned it ugly, I remember some people who were eager to say “Oh, but that ugly look is *itentional*. They *want* it to look cheap!”

Well after actually using it recently, I'd like to call bullshit on that statement. Not only is the UI very ugly, but the UX sucks. Strike that, the UX has not even been thought about. And *through* the UX I can see how theire code sucks too. Every message thrown at the user has some apologies about the ad maybe not being available until at least 24 hours except on saturday evenings where it appears only at the next half moon.

So maybe they have good designers who intentionnaly made the site look cheap and forged a crappy UI and developers who went out of their way to make sure the site doesnt work too well. Or maybe they can't get anything better done. My bet is on number 2.
