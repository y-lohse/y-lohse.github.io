# I'm building a motorracing management game

I'm a big fan of management games, and lately I've been really into motor racing. Naturally I played nearly every available game that combines these 2 genres, and while they are a lot of fun, I've been left with an itch to scratch. 

My issue is that none of them captures the full depth of race simulation. And i don't think teh itch is going anywhere.

The MotorSport Manager (MM) franchise, probably the reveered in this genre, is... gone. MM1 is still one of the best games out there but it's almost tean years old. MM2 is MM1 one for mobile with less depth, MM3 added the depth back in but made the game easier. Further titles have almost nothing to do with the original title anymore, they are more casual games with motorsport as a background. It's unlikely we'll ever get a new title worthy of the first installation.

The F1 Race Manager (RM) series has stopped. It's a good game, but the focus was always more on the F1 license than on th game mechanics.

I was super exited when Fun Selector announced Golden Lap – I'm a big fan of their previous games, and they definitely _get_ racing. But the game ended up (intentionally) on the arcade side of things – it's very fun, but not realistic.

I'm not including F1 Clash in this list – like the latest Motorsport Manager titles, racing is only a background theme, the game mechanics are unrelated to actual racing.

To my knowldge, only Openwheel Manager 2 is in deveopment. I would need to give it a try one of these days, but from the screenshot nothing leads me to believe it's significantly different from MM1.

## What I want to do differently

A race manegement game covers a couple of roles that exist in real life. I'd like a game that properly covers all of them.

### Race engineer

This one is present in all games of this genre, and it's captured by what you do in a race. Usually it boilds down to telling your drivers how much they can push on their engine and tires at any given time. I enjoy that part, although some games take this too far and it becomes a driver micromangement exercise. An example of this is in RC where I need to stop my drivers from emptying their ERS outside of overtake areas.

The other aspect of the race engineer role that's very enjoyable is the car setup. This is usually a game of finding the best balance in a limited amount of attempts. MM does this better with single preparation events – RM sticks too closely to the F1 week-end format, and you have to spend 3x30 minutes in practice sessions to get the best possible balance.

### Stategist

This one is my biggest gripe – no game really captures race strategy. First, I want a game where _I_ have to come up with a race strategy. And I need the tools to do it – predicted lap times, tire degradations, etc. RM is the best in that regard, but it's still too superficial.

More importantly, I want to make strategy call _during_ the race. This requires data (eg. I need to know if a car comes out in a traffic jam if I pit it now), and it requires pressure (if I can just pause the game and think about my choice while sipping a tea, the simulation looses it's charm). As a player, I should be under pressure during the race, and emerge almost exhausted from it.

### Chief Mechanic

Not an aspect of the game _I_ care too much about, but managing the pit crew's rotations and training is definitely a critical part of the job. MM1 does a fairly good job at this.

### Team principal

Specifically managing contractual matters, both with sponsors and drivers. Also the press.

Weirdly there's a game that nailed all of these aspects – it's called Anstoss 3, it's a 20 year old mostly-german soccer manager. To this day I haven't seen a game, let alone a sports sim, incorporate their ideas.

For negociations, it boilds down to: I need to know how the other party feels. I don't need to know their exact expectations, but a simple "yes/no" to any proposal tells me fuck all. What do they care about? What don't they? How far are we from reaching an agreement? From the conversation falling apart?

And for the press... I just want to answer some interview questions. Doesn't even matter what happens to my replies (although some procedurally generated drama would be excelent). That's it, but it adds _so much_ to the immersion.

### Infrastructure management

I don't know who's role that is in real life, but essentially taking care of the facilities. I don't find this part fascinating, and I find both MM and RM do a decent job at it.

### Technical director

Finally this is the other one that truely lacks depth in any game. The best one is probably RM, but mostly all of the existing titles let you spend money in exchange for upgraded stats on your car, and that's it.

This has nothing to do with engineering in real life. You never have to make a trade-off, you never have to commit to a direction without knowing the consequences, you never go out on track unsure if your changes are going to work out as expected.

I want a game that captures the trial and tribulation of a real engineering project. I want to come out on track one week-end like Aston Martin, and wonder why the upgrades have made things _worse_. And then when I understand, I want to come out like McLaren and become a competitive team within a couple of races.
