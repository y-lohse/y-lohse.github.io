<a title="Connections" href="http://code.yannick-lohse.fr/connections/connections.php?n=15">Here's something I created within one afternoon without any aim nor reason.</a> I just wanted a couple of dots that would connect to each others.
The resulting polygones are very natural : the only things the dot do is :
<ul>
	<li>when not too far away from another, get together</li>
	<li>when too close to each other, get appart</li>
	<li>draw connections between each other when close</li>
</ul>
Also, you can change the number of particles by changing the value of n in the url.
