[![Mandelbrot fractal]({{ site.img_path }}/2010/06/fractals.png)](http://yannick-lohse.fr/2010/06/html5-fractals/)

A [Mandelbrot fractal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set "Wikipedia page on Mandelbrot set") displayed within a html5 canvas. A part from being pretty cool from a methmatical point of view, fractals are also cute and inifinite.

However, this app features heavy performance problems; there's more or less a second of lag every time an image is displayed, sorry for that :s
