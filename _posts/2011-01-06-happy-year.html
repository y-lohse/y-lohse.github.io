<a href="http://yannick-lohse.fr/2011/01/happy-year/"><img class="wp-image-120 alignleft" title="hny" src="http://yannick-lohse.fr/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/temp-300x170.png" alt="Happy New Year" width="316" height="179" /></a>I made <a title="Happy New Year" href="http://code.yannick-lohse.fr/hny/hny.php">this one</a> on the 1st of january while seriously hungover, but anyway. I was looking for an opportunity to try and reproduce the wheel clock display that can be found on iphones/ipods, so I grabbed the occasion. I don't think I quite matched the effect, but I'm unable to find out why. <a title="Happy New Year" href="http://code.yannick-lohse.fr/hny/hny.php">Anyway, happy new year every one, may it bring fun, love, success and what not.</a>

Just a word on the technical aspect : fonts are from <a title="Google Web Fonts" href="http://code.google.com/webfonts">Google Web Fonts</a>, no flash/canvas, just pure html/css. Gradients are done through css3, and the animation with jquery (but could have been with css3 animate too).
