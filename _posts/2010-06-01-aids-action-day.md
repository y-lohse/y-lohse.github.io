[This has been created as a (volonteer) job](http://code.yannick-lohse.fr/kamasutra/sidaction.php) for people who were throwing a party were benefits would be given to AIDS fighting NPOs. 2 couples would come up on stage and have to mime the kamasutra position displayed within 10 seconds. The winner couple would have a free drink or something.

The awesome images (which have been created by my friend [Jeremy Kleinclaus](http://www.gecko-webdesign.fr/)) are external and loaded from a xml file, beacause the people I was doing this for wanted to be able to reuse it and add positions easily. [Check it out here!](http://code.yannick-lohse.fr/kamasutra/sidaction.php)
