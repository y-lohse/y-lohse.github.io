[Here's one more shot on fractals in HTML5](http://code.yannick-lohse.fr/fractals/buddha.php "Buddhabrot fractals"), and this one is pretty cool: it generates a [Buddhabrot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhabrot "Wikipedia page on Buddhabrot").

A  Buddhabrot is another way to display a Mandelbrot fractal; the image   appears gradually and looks like a Buddha. This is pretty impressive, since the resulting image stays away from any human influence; the formula used results from the observation of natural phenomenons. There's actually no real scientific explanation for this, which makes it pretty fascinating.

The generator allows you to set the amount of iterations you want to make; the more there are, the longer it will take, but the Buddha will look better… until a certain limit where the image will simply be white. You can also configure it to show the Buddha every few images and see how it takes shape.

[The generator can be found here.](http://code.yannick-lohse.fr/fractals/buddha.php "Generate fractals. Now.")
