[A shooting range](http://code.yannick-lohse.fr/swf/shooting.swf) implementing some concepts, including easing, sounds, shooting reports…
Point counting isn't too great; basically, the longer you take to shoot, the less points you have… but the result isn't always very logical. The target on the right is only there to tell you where you hit, so don't try to shoot it :p… and yes, everything is pretty white.

**Controls** : Mouse to aim, scroll to change zoom level. R to reload, M to change shooting mode.
