Do you feel like a web Ninja/Pirate/Warrior?  Then check out my latest 'work' : [http://5z8.info/white-power-rides-upon-stallions-unstoppable_g4a1zv_facebook-hack](http://5z8.info/white-power-rides-upon-stallions-unstoppable_g4a1zv_facebook-hack)

## Oh god I'm so scared, wont you tell me what's behind this link?

Ok first off, don't be afraid. The page is just going to piss you off for a minute or so, but with some basic computer skills you should be able to close the window soon enough. The link looks suspicious because I used [ShadyUrl ](http://www.shadyurl.com/) to "shorten" it. I f you're still not sure about it, here is the direct link : [http://code.yannick-lohse.fr/monster/ "Unleash the kraken"](http://code.yannick-lohse.fr/monster/).

If you *still* don't feel like trying it out by yourself… Well, the page contains a bit of javascript that is designed to piss you off. Once started, your cursor will disapear, most keyboard shortcuts will be gone, and a few other happy things you might not event notice. Of course once the tab/window closed everything goes back to normal. I also refrained from using any bad taste technique (not that any that I used is of good taste) like making about 4598745 dialog windows pop up, infinite loops or whatever might make you want to crash your browser.

## Ok, now why?
Just testing out how much you could make a website user-un-friendly without being too nasty.
