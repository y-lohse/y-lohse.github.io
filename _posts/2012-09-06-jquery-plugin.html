According to the last modification date of the file, <a title="My first jquery plugin !" href="http://code.yannick-lohse.fr/elemental/">I created this jquery plugin</a> back in march 2011. As far as I remember, I was exploring 2 things at the same time :
<ul>
	<li>what fancy things can you do with the (at that time fairly) new text-shadow css property ?</li>
	<li>how do you write your own jquery plugin ?</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://yannick-lohse.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/elemental.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-353" title="elemental" src="http://yannick-lohse.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/elemental-300x122.png" alt="Waterfall effect on text" width="300" height="122" /></a>So I very naturally combined both things into one, creating this elemental plugin. I don't see any real use cases except if you want to create a web page that looks like it was made in the 90's.

On the css part, it's quite simple. I just stack a couple of text shadows on top of each other; the change in size and color gives the impression of a gradient.

On the JS side, it's worth noting that it's really easy to create a jQuery plugin. You need to make sure your plugin stuff doesn't leak into the global space, but apart from that, it's just good old javascript. If you want to take a look at it, I used it as my hello world <a href="https://github.com/y-lohse/smoke">repo on GitHub</a>.
