<h3>Oh god I'm so scared, wont you tell me what's behind this link?</h3>
Ok first off, don't be afraid. The page is just going to piss you off for a minute or so, but with some basic computer skills you should be able to close the window soon enough. The link looks suspicious because I used <a href="http://www.shadyurl.com/">ShadyUrl </a>to ''shorten'' it. I f you're still not sure about it, here is the direct link : <a title="Unleash the kraken" href="http://code.yannick-lohse.fr/monster/">http://code.yannick-lohse.fr/monster/</a>.

If you <em>still</em> don't feel like trying it out by yourself... Well, the page contains a bit of javascript that is designed to piss you off. Once started, your cursor will disapear, most keyboard shortcuts will be gone, and a few other happy things you might not event notice. Of course once the tab/window closed everything goes back to normal. I also refrained from using any bad taste technique (not that any that I used is of good taste) like making about 4598745 dialog windows pop up, infinite loops or whatever might make you want to crash your browser.
<h3>Ok, now why?</h3>
Just testing out how much you could make a website user-un-friendly without being too nasty.
