[![Happy Christamas]({{ site.img_path }}/2010/12/xmas.png "xmas")](http://yannick-lohse.fr/2010/12/xmas/)
Even if I'm not too much of a Christmas fan, no occasion to spread joy and happiness should be neglected, so here's my [very own christmas card](http://code.yannick-lohse.fr/xmas/noel.php "Merry xmas").

Depending on when you look at the card, the colors will be different. They are computed based on a section the current timestamp, as shown here. The gradient starts with a color at (red, green, blue) and stops at (blue, red, green) which gives surprisingly nice colors most of the time.

[Merry Christmas :)](http://code.yannick-lohse.fr/xmas/noel.php "Happy xmas")
