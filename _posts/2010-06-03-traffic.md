A little experiment simulating some road traffic. Designed to toy around with the HTML5 canvas and the possibilities it offers (they are HUGE), I didn't want to go any further into this experiment, since the code base was not designed to do so. But it's still fun to watch the cars -not- stopping at the redlights.
