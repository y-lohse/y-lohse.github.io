<a href="http://yannick-lohse.fr/2010/07/map-displacement-2/"><img class="wp-image-133 alignright" title="mon" src="http://yannick-lohse.fr/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/mon-242x300.png" alt="Mona Lisa - now with a different head." width="242" height="300" /></a>And <a title="Map Displacing Mona Lisa" href="http://code.yannick-lohse.fr/mapdisplacement/bitmap3.php">here comes the other Map Displacement filter demo</a>. To apply the filter, click anywhere on the picture, move the mouse around and release the click... tadaaa! Be gentle with Mona' thought.

The filter isn't real time applied because of performance issues. It takes about half a second to calculate the displacement, where it would have to take 10 times less to consider doing it in real time. But it could be done, I just didn't think it was worth the effort for this demo.

Another note on the performance issue : the amount of time it takes is mainly due to the canvas pixel array accessing stuff. And apparently, things get a lot better with Firefox 4, and I wouldn't wonder if Chrome wasn't putting some effort into this too... which means we'll see more and more of this kind of effects \o/
