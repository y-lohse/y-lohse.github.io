[Experimenting the new HTML5 Audio tag "HTML5 audio"](http://code.yannick-lohse.fr/audio/). The result is alright, but could be way better; The main problem being that this tag is not completely implemented in any browser right now. Even worth, vendors choose what to implement in what order, making only some features available in their browser.

But this new tag is still pretty cool and I believe it will be good enough to replace Flash for basic sound usage soon enough. But I have a grief with advanced usageâ€¦ well in short, the specifications don't even plan the implementation of things like pitch control, pan control, and whatever could be used to do even cooler things with it. Of course this is already a huge progress, but since HTML version take several years to spread enough to be used, it would have been cool to build that in right from the start.

I used a custom canvas library to do the turntable stuff, I'll get back on it in another post.
