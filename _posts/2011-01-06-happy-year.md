[![Happy New Year]({{ site.img_path }}/2011/01/temp-300x170.png "hny")](http://yannick-lohse.fr/2011/01/happy-year/)
I made [this one](http://code.yannick-lohse.fr/hny/hny.php "Happy New Year") on the 1st of january while seriously hungover, but anyway. I was looking for an opportunity to try and reproduce the wheel clock display that can be found on iphones/ipods, so I grabbed the occasion. I don't think I quite matched the effect, but I'm unable to find out why. [Anyway, happy new year every one, may it bring fun, love, success and what not.](http://code.yannick-lohse.fr/hny/hny.php "Happy New Year")

Just a word on the technical aspect: fonts are from [Google Web Fonts](http://code.google.com/webfonts "Google Web Fonts"), no flash/canvas, just pure html/css. Gradients are done through css3, and the animation with jquery (but could have been with css3 animate too).
