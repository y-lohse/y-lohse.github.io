[Here's something I created within one afternoon without any aim nor reason.](http://code.yannick-lohse.fr/connections/connections.php?n=15 "Connections") I just wanted a couple of dots that would connect to each others.

The resulting polygones are very natural, the only things the dot do is:

- when not too far away from another, get together
- when too close to each other, get appart
- draw connections between each other when close

Also, you can change the number of particles by changing the value of n in the url.
