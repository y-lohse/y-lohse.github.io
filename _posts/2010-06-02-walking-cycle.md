Right arrow to walk, nothing to stop walking. Right arrow + shift to start running... and you can't stop either, a few frames are missing.
Each frame is hand drawn and the animation is using 24 fps. The whole thing is composed of roughly 100 images, which took quite a lot of time =). (Don't forget to click the animation to give it focus before you start anything.)
